DONE - There are two stocks with A LOT of missing values (see the part "dealing with missing values"). We should plot them(x=time, y = value)
DONE - At "Step 2: Defining the distributions for the market conditions". There are plots of the factors returns. (first four ones). 
It should be cool to have the factorsReturns and the normal distribution model associated on the same chart.
- Training and testing on the same data is not a good idea. we could do cross validatation and see the results.
- Since the last question ask us to try different probabilty distributions. I suggest trying with those distributions:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution

- It would be nice to have a measure of how well is a model distribution fitting our factors. I suggest something like integral((factor-model)**2).
With this, a function could choose which factor should have which model based on this measure (could save us a lot of time)
- We associate stocks returns to factor with a linear model. for each factor, we associate x: (sqrt(x),x,x**2). 
we could try something like (sqrt(x),x,x**2,exp(x))
or (x,x**2) to avoid overfitting.
Also that and remove the 4th factor (useless) to see if it gets better.
And use mean square error to check all that.
- The thing to see if we can break down the problem into 2 smaller problems. model factor distribution and model the link between the factors and the stocks.
If the measure for both problems is better, we should check if the Kupiec test p-value is higher.
