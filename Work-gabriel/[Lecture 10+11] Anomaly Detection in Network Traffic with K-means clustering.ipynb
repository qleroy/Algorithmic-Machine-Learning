    "We can categorize machine learning algorithms into two main groups: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. With supervised learning algorithms, in order to predict unknown values for new data, we have to know the target value for many previously-seen examples. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms explore the data which has no target attribute to find some intrinsic structures in them.\n",

For a thorough overview of K-means clustering, from a research perspective, have a look at this wonderful [tutorial](http://theory.stanford.edu/~sergei/slides/kdd10-thclust.pdf)."

    "# 1. K-means\n",
    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "Clustering is a typical and well-known type of unsupervised learning. Clustering algorithms try to find natural groupings in data. Similar data points (according to some notion of similarity) are considered in the same group. We call these groups **clusters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means clustering is a simple and widely-used clustering algorithm. Given value of $k$, it tries to build $k$ clusters from samples in the dataset. Therefore, $k$ is an hyperparameter of the model. The right value of $k$ is not easy to determine, as it highly depends on the data set and the way that data is featurized.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measue the similarity between any two data points, K-means requires the definition of a distance funtion between data points. What is a distance? It is a value that indicates how close two data points are in their space. In particular, when data points lie in a $d$-dimensional space, the Euclidean distance is a good choice of a distance function, and is supported by MLLIB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In K-means, a cluster is a group of points, with a representative entity called a centroid. A centroid is also a point in the data space: the center of all the points that make up the cluster. It's defined to be the arithmetic mean of the points. In general, when working with K-means, each data sample is represented in a $d$-dimensional numeric vector, for which it is easier to define an appropriate distance function. As a consequence, in some applications, the original data must be transformed into a different representation, to fit the requirements of K-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. How does it work ?\n",
    "Given $k$, the K-means algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly choose $k$ data points (seeds) to be the initial centroids\n",
    "2. Assign each data point to the **closest centroid**\n",
    "3. Re-compute (update) the centroids using the current cluster memberships\n",
    "4. If a convergence criterion is not met, go to step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also terminate the algorithm when it reaches an iteration budget, which yields an approximate result.\n",
    "From the pseudo-code of the algorithm, we can see that K-means clustering results can be sensitive to the order in which data samples in the data set are explored. A sensible practice would be to run the analysis several times, randomizing objects order; then, average the cluster centres of those runs and input the centres as initial ones for one final run of the analysis."

    "Some exploit behaviors follow known patterns such as scanning every port in a short of time, sending a burst of request to a port... However, the biggest threat may be the one that has never been detected and classified yet. Part of detecting potential network intrusions is detecting anomalies. These are connections that aren't known to be attacks, but, do not resemble connections that have been observed in the past.\n",

    "The data comes from [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html). The dataset is about 708MB and contains about 4.9M connections. For each connection, the data set contains information like the number of bytes sent, login attempts, TCP errors, and so on. Each connection is one line of CSV-formatted data, containing 38 features: back, buffer_overflow, ftp_write, guess_passwd, imap, ipsweep, land, loadmodule, multihop, neptune, nmap, normal, perl, phf, pod, portsweep, rootkit, satan, smurf, spy, teardrop, warezclient, warezmaster. For more details about each features, please follow this [link](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).\n",

Note that computing such metrics, that is trying to assess the quality of your clustering results, is as computationally intensive as computing the clustering itself!"

    "How many clusters are appropriate for a dataset? In particular, for our own dataset, it's clear that there are 23 distinct behavior patterns in the data, so it seems that k could be at least 23, or likely, even more. In other cases, we even don't have any information about the number of patterns at all (remember, generally your data is not labelled!). Our task now is finding a good value of $k$. For doing that, we have to build and evaluate models with different values of $k$. A clustering could be considered good if each data point were near to its closest centroid. One of the ways to evaluate a model is calculating the Mean of Squared Errors of all data points."

    "### 2.3.1 Loading data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we ignored the categorical features of our data: this is not a good idea, since these categorical features can be important in providing useful information for clustering.\n",
    "The problem is that K-means (or at least, the one we have developed and the one we use from MLLib) only work with data points in a metric space. Informally, this means that operations such as addition, substraction and computing the mean of data points are trivial and well defined. For a more formal definition of what a metric space is, follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space#Definition).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do next is to transform each categorical features into one or more numerical features. This approach is very widespread: imagine for example you wanted to use K-means to cluster text data. Then, the idea is to transform text data in $d$-dimensional vectors, and a nice way to do it is to use [word2vec](http://deeplearning4j.org/word2vec). If you're interested, follow this link to a nice [blog post](http://bigdatasciencebootcamp.com/posts/Part_3/clustering_news.html) on the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Approach 1**: mapping **one** categorial feature to **one** numerical feature. The values in each categorical feature are encoded into unique numbers of the new numerical feature. For example, ['VERY HOT','HOT', 'COOL', 'COLD', 'VERY COLD'] will be encoded into [0,1,2,3,4,5]. However, by using this method, we implicit assume that the value of 'VERY HOT' is smaller than 'HOT'... This is not generally true.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Approach 2**: mapping mapping **one** categorial feature to **multiple** numerical features. Basically, a single variable with $n$ observations and $d$ distinct values, to $d$ binary variables with $n$ observations each. Each observation indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of the $d^{th}$ binary variable. For example, ['house', 'car', 'tooth', 'car'] becomes \n",
    "```\n",
    "[\n",
    "[1,0,0,0],\n",
    "[0,1,0,0],\n",
    "[0,0,1,0],\n",
    "[0,0,0,1],\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the second approach \"one-hot encoding\". By using this approach, we keep the same role for all values of categorical features.\n",

    "When we have a new connection data (e.g., one that we never saw before), we simply find the closest cluster for it, and use this information as a proxy to indicate whether the data point is anomalous or not. A simple approach to decide wheter there is an anomaly or not, amounts to measuring the new data point’s distance to its nearest centroid. If this distance exceeds some thresholds, it is anomalous."

You are strongly invited to use the Python API (pyspark). So, at the end of the day, you will operate on RDDs, and implement a \"map/reduce\" algorithm that performs the two phases of the standard K-means algorithm, i.e. the assignment step and the update step."
